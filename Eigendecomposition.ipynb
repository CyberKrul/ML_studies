    "## Interpretations of Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors\n",
    "There are several ways of interpreting these:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geometry\n",
    "An eigenvector means that matrix-vector multiplication acts like scalar-vector multiplication. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the matrix stretched, but did not rotate- that vector. The vector is an eigenvector of the matrix, and the amount of stretching is the eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenvalue equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{A}v=\\lambda v$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: it does not say that the matrix equals the scalar: just that the effect of the matrix on the vector is the same as the effect of the scalar on that same vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the eigenvalue equation, and it's another key formula in linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistics (PCA)\n",
    "One of the reasons people use statistics is to identify and quantify relationships between variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a multivariate dataset that includes dozens or hundreds of variables, bivariate correlation cannot reveal global patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider cryptocurrencies- there are tens of thousands of other cryptocurrencies that have various purposes. We can ask whether the entirety of the crypto space operates as a single system (meaning they all go up and down together), or whether there are independent subcategories within that space (some coins or groups of coins change in value independently of the value of other coins).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can test this hypothesis by performing a PCA on a dataset that contains the prices of various cryptocurrencies over time. If the entire crypto market operates as a single entity, then the screen plot (a graph of the eigenvalues of the dataset's covariance matrix) would reveal that one component accounts for most of the variance of the system, and all other components account for very little variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, if the crypto market had say, three major subcategories with independent price movements, then we would expect to see three large eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Noise Reduction\n",
    "Most datasets contain noise. *Noise* refers to variance in a dataset that is either unexplained (random variation) or unwanted (electrical line noise). There are many ways to attenuate or eliminate noise, and the optimal noise-reduction strategy depends on the nature and origin of the noise and on the characteristics of the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "One method of reducing random noise is to identify the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a system, and 'project out' directions in the data space associated with small eigenvalues. The assumption is that random noise makes a relatively small contribution to the total variance. 'Projecting out' a data dimension means reconstructing a dataset after setting some eigenvalues that are below some threshold to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimension Reduction (Data Compression)\n",
    "Information Communication technologies create and transmit a huge amount of data, such as pictures and videos. Transmitting data can be time-consuming and expensive, and it is beneficial to compress the data before transmitting it. Compression means to reduce the size of the data while having minimal impact on the quality of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "eg- TIFF format image file might be 10MB, while the JPG converted version might be .1 MB while still retaining reasonably high quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to dimension reduce a dataset is to take its eigendecomposition, drop the eigenvalues and eigenvectors associated with small directions in the data space, and then transmit only the relatively larger eigenvector/value pairs. (SVD is usually used for data compression)."

    "## Finding Eigenvalues\n",
    "To eigendecompose a square matrix, you first find the eigenvalues and then use each eigenvalue to find its corresponding eigenvector. The eigenvalues are like keys that you insert into the matrix to unlock the mystical eigenvectors.\n",

    "The left-hand side of the second equation has two vector terms, both of which involve $v$. So we factor out the vector. But that leaves us with the subtraction of a matrix and a scalar ($\\mathbf{A}-\\lambda$), which is not a defined operation in linear algebra. So instead we *shift* the matrix by $\\lambda$. That brings us to the third equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It means that *the eigenvector is in the null space of the matrix shifted by its eigenvalue*\n",

    "$\\tilde{\\mathbf{A}}v=0$\n",
    "\n",

    "- This reveals that the eigenvector is in the null space of the matrix shifted by the eigenvalues. We do not consider the zeros vector to be an eigenvector, which means the shifted matrix is singular.\n",
    "- therefore, we set the determinant of the shifted matrix to zero and solve for the unknown  eigenvalue.\n",

    "The determinant of an eigenvalue-shifted matrix set to zero is called the *characteristic polynomial* of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",

    "### The Quadratic form of a matrix\n",
    "Consider the following expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$w^T\\mathbf{A}w=\\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we pre- and post-multiply a square matrix by the same vector $w$ and get a scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called the *quadratic form* on matrix $\\mathbf{A}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which matrix and which vector do we use? The idea of the quadratic form is to use one specific matrix and the set of all possible vectors. The important question concerns the signs of $\\alpha$ for all possible vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{bmatrix}x&y\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}2&4\\\\0&3\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}x\\\\ y\\end{bmatrix}=2x^2+(0+4)xy+3y^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "For this possible matrix, there is no possible combination of $x$ and $y$ that can give a negative answer, because the squared terms ($2x^2$ and $3y^2$) will always overpower the cross-term $4xy$ even when $x$ and $y$ is negative. Further, $\\alpha$ can be nonpositive only when $x=y=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is not a trivial result of the quadratic form: for example, the following matrix can have a positive or negative $\\alpha$ depending on the values of $x$ and $y$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{bmatrix}x&y\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}-9&4\\\\3&9\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}x\\\\ y\\end{bmatrix}=-9x^2+(3+4)xy+9y^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we know whether the quadratic form will produce a positive scalar for all possible vectors? The key comes from considering that a full-rank eigenvectors matrix spans all of $\\mathbf{R}^M$, and therefore that every vector in $\\mathbf{R}^M$ can be expressed as some linear weighted combination of the eigenvectors. Then we start from the eigenvalue equation and left-multiply it by an eigenvector to return to the quadratic form.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{A}v=\\lambda v$<br>\n",
    "$v^T\\mathbf{A}v=\\lambda v^Tv$<br>\n",
    "$v^T\\mathbf{A}v=\\lambda\\lVert v\\rVert ^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "the final equation is key- notice that $\\lVert v^Tv\\rVert$ is strictly positive, which means that the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ entirely determines the sign of the right-hand side of the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation uses only one eigenvalue and its eigenvector, but we need to know about any possible vector. The insight is to consider that if the equation is valid for each eigenvector-eigenvalue pair, it is valid for any combination of eigenvector-eigenvalue pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_1^T\\mathbf{A}v_1=\\lambda_1\\lVert v_1\\rVert^2$<br>\n",
    "$v_2^T\\mathbf{A}v_2=\\lambda_2\\lVert v_2\\rVert^2$<br>\n",
    "$(v_1+v_2)^T\\mathbf{A}(v_1+v_2)=(\\lambda_1+\\lambda_2)\\lVert (v_1+v_2)\\rVert^2$<br>\n",
    "$u^T\\mathbf{A}u=\\zeta\\lVert u\\rVert^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can set any vector $u$ to be some linear combination of eigenvectors, and some scalar $\\zeta$ to be that same linear combination of eigenvalues. Anyway, it doesn't change the principle that the sign of the right-hand side- and therefore also the sign of the quadratic form- is determined by the sign of the eigenvalues\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about these equations under different assumptions about the signs of the $\\lambda$s.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *All eigenvalues are positive*<br> The right-hand side of the equation is always positive, meaning that $v^T\\mathbf{A}v$ is always positive for any vector $v$.\n",
    "- *Eigenvalues are positive or zero*<br> $v^T\\mathbf{A}v$ is nonnegative and will equal zero when $\\lambda=0$ (which happens when matrix is singular)\n",
    "- *Eigenvalues are negative or zero*<br> The quadratic form result will be zero or negative\n",
    "- *Eigenvalues are negative*<br> The quadratic form result will be negative for all vectors"

    "## Definiteness\n",
    "*Definiteness* is a characteristic of a square matrix and is defined by the signs of the eigenvalues of the matrix, which is the same thing as the signs of the quadratic form results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definiteness has implications for the invertibility of a matrix as well as advanced data analysis methods such as generalized eigendecomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five categories of definiteness:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Category|Quadratic Form|Eigenvalues|Invertible|\n",
    "|--------|--------------|-----------|----------|\n",
    "|Positive definite|Positive|+|Yes|\n",

    "|Indefinite|Positive and Negative|+ and -|Depends|\n",
    "|Negative semidefinite|Nonpositive|- and 0|No|\n",
    "|Negative definite|Negative|-|Yes|\n",
    "\n",
    "Depends in the table means that the matrix can be invertible or singular depending on the numbers in the matrix, not on the definiteness category.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\mathbf{A}^T\\mathbf{A}$ is Positive (semi)Definite\n",
    "Any matrix that can be expressed as the product of a matrix and its transpose is guaranteed to be positive definite or positive semi-definite. The combination of these two categories is often written as 'positive semi-definite'\n",
    "\n",
    "All data covariance matrices are positive semi-definite because they are defined as the data matrix times its transpose. This means that all covariances matrices have nonnegative eigenvalues. The eigenvalues will be all positive when the data matrix is full-rank, and there will be at least one zero-valued eigenvalue if the data matrix is reduced-rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proof that $\\mathbf{S}$ is positive semi-definite comes from writing out its quadratic form and applying some algebraic manipulations. \n",

    "Generalized eigendecomposition is also called *simultaneous diagonalization of two matrices*. The resulting $(\\lambda,v)$ is not an eigenvalue-vector of $\\mathbf{A}$ alone nor of $\\mathbf{B}$ alone. Instead, the two matrices share eigenvalue-vector pairs.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "1. Eigendecomposition identifies $M$ scalar/vector pairs of an $M\\times M$ matrix. Those pairs of eigenvalue/eigenvector reflect special directions in the matrix and have many applications in data science (PCA being a common one)\n",
    "2. Eigenvalues are found by assumign that the matrix shifted by an unknown scalar $\\lambda$ is singular, setting its determinant to zero (called the characteristic polynomial), and solving for $\\lambda$s\n",
    "3. *Diagonalizing* a matrix means to represent it as $\\mathbf{V}^{-1}\\mathbf{\\Lambda V}$, where $\\mathbf{V}$ is a matrix with eigenvectors in the columns an $\\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues in the diagonal elements.\n",
    "4. Symmetric matrices have several special properties in eigendecompositions, the most relevant being:\n",
    "   - all eigenvectors are pair-wise orthogonal.\n",
    "   - This means that the matrix of eigenvectors is an orthogonal matrix (when the eigenvectors are unit normalized), which in turn means that the inverse of the eigenvectors matrix is its transpose\n",
    "5. The *definiteness* of a matrix refers to  the signs of its eigenvalues. In Data Science, the most relevant categories are positive (semi) definite, which means that all eigenvalues are either nonnegative or positive\n",
    "6. A matrix times its transpose is always positive (semi) definite, which means all covariance matrices have non-negative eigenvalues\n",
    "7. the product of the eigenvalues equals the determinant\n",
    "8. Not all square matrices can be diagonalized; some have repeated eigenvalues, which has implications for their eigenvectors;"
