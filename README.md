## Practical Linear Algebra for Data Science
Linear Algebra is a central topic when to comes to ML and DL related math, and throughly familiarizing myself with the central topics of the subject was essential
Unfortunately, while the MIT lectures and various books were very helpful during my Bachelor's, I still felt something was missing;
I knew all these theories that I simply couldn't visualize or otherwise manifest; however, this book helped bridge the mental gap I had developed.
It is a fairly thorough book, not delving into proofs and such, but focusing on the process and operation of important topics: determinants, QR Decomposition, Eigendecomposition and SVD-
all topics of great relevance. The coding exercises given within were extremely helpful as well.

Through my study, I prepared notes within my notebooks, and I'm leaving them out here in this repository, if anyone would like to take a leaf out of my books.
